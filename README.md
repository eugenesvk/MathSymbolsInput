# Unicode input method

## Development

To update the input method with your local debug build, switch to a different input method and run `./install.sh`.
## Keyboard layouts

By default, macOS uses the last keyboard layout when an input method is active.
So, to use your desired keyboard layout, activate the keyboard layout first and
then the MathSymbolsInput input method.
